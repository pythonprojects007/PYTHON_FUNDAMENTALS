# Recursion
# Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

# Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

# The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

# In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

def try_recursion(k):
    print("checking........")
    if k>0:
       try_recursion(k-3)
    else:
        print("it is done") 
    

try_recursion(3)
